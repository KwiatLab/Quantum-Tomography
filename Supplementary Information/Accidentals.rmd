# Introduction
Accidentals
$$A_{i,j} = \frac{ S_{i,j,0}S_{i,j,1} W_j}{T_i}$$

- $T_i$ Is the time of measurement i given as an input. Default is 1
- $W_j$ Is the coincidence window duration as an input. Default is 0
- i,j corresponds to a detector pair A-B. $S_{i,j,0}$ Is the singles count on detector A. $S_{i,j,I}$ Is the singles count on detector B.

Here is how the detector are paired up
